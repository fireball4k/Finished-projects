Overview:
This Cruddy Pizza assignment is primarily intended for students to demonstrate their knowledge of:
Data persistence using SQLite (Order Info). 
Data persistence using Shared Preferences (Bilingual UI Settings).
String Arrays
UI design and internationalization

Functionality:
This application will display a list of options for building a pizza. Once the order is finished it is to be saved (created). Additional functionality will allow the user to display all orders (read), a specific order (read), modify the order (update), and cancel the order (delete). Let the user know when each operation is complete. The UI is to be able to be switched between English and French and maintain state on that setting between start-ups.

Layout Options:
Layout is up to the student and should look professional with a good choice of colors / images and have a good functional layout with appropriate control types.

Data persistence – SQLite:
Implement the use of an SQLite database into your application in order to demonstrate your familiarity with that technology. Your solution must have full CRUD capability. Orders may be “atomic” in that you do not need to keep a separate table of customers for future orders or marketing data. Validation is required for all non-selectable fields e.g. phone number. <br>
